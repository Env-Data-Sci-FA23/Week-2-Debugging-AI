```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Loading in the data
Storms <- read.csv("/Users/melissamorales/Desktop/Week-2-Debugging-AI/Data/storms.csv")
```

Grouping data by year and finding the average storm pressure per year

```{r}
# Grouping data by year
Storms %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  
# Finding the average storm pressure per year 
  summarise(mean_wind = mean(wind, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Visualizing the data

```{r}
# Summarize mean wind speed by year
wind_means <- Storms %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_wind = mean(wind, na.rm = TRUE))

# Look at summarized data
head(wind_means)

# Bar chart of mean wind   
ggplot(data = wind_means, aes(x = year, y = mean_wind)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Mean Wind Speed per Year",  
       x = "Year",
       y = "Mean Wind Speed")
```

Visualizing the trend with a regression line, regression analysis, & ANOVA

```{r}
# Visualize trend with regression line
ggplot(wind_means, aes(x = year, y = mean_wind)) +
  geom_col() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Mean Wind Speed per Year",
       x = "Year",  
       y = "Mean Wind Speed")

# Regression analysis  
fit <- lm(mean_wind ~ year, data = wind_means)
summary(fit)

# ANOVA
anova(fit)
```

Conclusion:

-   P-value of 0.3824 (regression analysis)

-   F-value of 0.778 (ANOVA)

-   No statistically significant relationship between year and mean wind speed in th storms data.


```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Looking at storms & their status
storm_counts <- storms %>%
  group_by(year, status) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Visualizing storm statuses
ggplot(storm_counts, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~status) +
  labs(
    title = "Storm Status Frequency by Year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Frequency"
  )
```


```{r}
# Load the required libraries
library(dplyr)

# Remove NA categories
storms <- storms %>% 
  filter(!is.na(category))

# Analyze the data by grouping it by year and category
summary_table <- storms %>%
  group_by(year, category) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

# To view the summary table

  labs(title = "Storm Categories by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Count") +

  theme(legend.position = "right")
